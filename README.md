# Surfs_up

## Overview of the Statistical analysis

- The purpose of the analysis is to observe temperature trends to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Sources

- Data:[Hawaii]()

- Softwares: Python 3.7(SQLite Library), Jupyter Notebook 6.4

## Analysis

### Results

- The link to the script of the analysis is :[Surfs_up_Challenge]()

- The summary statistics of June are 

![June_Summary]()

- The summary statistics of December are 

![Dec_Summary]()

- Oberserving the summary statistics above, the number of temparature obervations in June are higher than in December. Therefore, the June statistics maybe more accurate than December statistics.

- The minimum temperature in December is lower as compared to June, so the water temperature will be higher in June making it more favorable for surfing.

- The maximum temperature is higher in June than the maximum temparature in December, creating better conditions for eating ice-cream.

### Summary

- The Surf and Ice-cream shop can be successful round the year but will have more favorable conditions in June as compared to December.

- Futher analysis can be performed to make more informed deccisions based on which stations have more ideal conditions, i.e. there is less amount of precipitation.

- For the above stations, analysis can be performed on the "Stations" table to determine which of those stations have lower elevation so they are more accesible to customers i.e. the shop is closer to the water.
